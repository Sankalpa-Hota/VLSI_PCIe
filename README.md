PCIe Verilog Development

This repository contains a custom PCI Express (PCIe) core development project implemented in Verilog HDL, focusing on understanding, simulating, and building the fundamental layers of the PCIe protocol stack — from the physical interface up to transaction-level packet handling. The aim is to design a lightweight, educational, and synthesizable PCIe endpoint architecture for FPGA or ASIC-based systems.

Project Overview

This project walks through the modular design of a PCIe Endpoint Controller, built from the ground up in Verilog. Each layer is implemented as an independent, testable module, emphasizing protocol correctness, data integrity, and timing closure.
